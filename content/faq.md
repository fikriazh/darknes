### Use Service Data to Identify Your Most Common Questions.
Your FAQ page should address the most common questions customers have about your products, services, and brand as a whole. The best way to identify those questions is to tap into your customer service data and see which problems customers are consistently reaching out to you with. 

If you have a help desk or call center software you can easily discover the most popular questions that customers have for your team. Some ticketing systems even offer tagging features that allow agents to label individual tickets which then automatically categorizes them in a stored database. That way, you can sort your tickets by topic, date, or popularity, when you're analyzing your team's data. 

### Decide How You'll Organize the FAQ Page.
As you'll see from the examples below, not every FAQ page looks the same. Depending on what your company is selling and how many products it offers, your FAQ page might consist of a single page with a list of questions or several pages linked together. What's best for your business will vary based on the needs of your customers and how easy it is to troubleshoot your products. 

If your FAQ page does consist of multiple pages, then one critical element you'll need to consider is your navigation bar. If your search bar is tricky to use or doesn't yield desired results, customers won't have the patience to sift through pages one by one until they find an answer. When creating your knowledge base articles, try to use searchable keywords in both your post titles and in your writing. This will make your pages easier to find since they'll include the same terms and phrases that visitors searching for. 

### Include Space for Live Support Options.
FAQ pages are intended as an initial support option for customers looking for an immediate answer to a quick question or problem. It shouldn't replace your knowledge base or your entire support team, but rather supplement your support channels as an additional, lightweight resource. 

When customers do have questions that extend beyond the range of your FAQ page, you should have options available that directly connect them with your support team. You could add a link that opens a new support ticket or even just list your call center's phone number at the bottom of the page. The idea is that customers shouldn't have to navigate back to your home page just to locate your company's email or phone number. 

### Design Your FAQ Page.
The next step is to design your FAQ page. We have some handy tips for doing this located in the next section of this post. But, if you can't wait until then, here's a jump link so you can skip on down. 

### Publish the FAQ Page on Your Site. 
Once your FAQ page is ready, it's time to publish it to your website. Most companies will provide a link to the FAQ page in their website's main navigation bar, so no matter where they are on the site, visitors can go directly to the page if they need help. 

If you have a knowledge base, then you may want to add the FAQ page as a section of this resource. In this case, makes sure your FAQ page is extremely searchable and includes plenty of keywords that will make it easily accessible to customers searching your website. 

### Monitor the FAQ Page's Performance.
With your page up and running, customers should be more successful in finding solutions to common problems. To find out if that's the case, you'll need to revisit the customer data that you used to create your FAQ page in the first place. 

Go back to the categories that you used to segment your support cases. Are there any differences between now and before? Are the same problems affecting your customer base? Or, are you noticing case volume for your most common problems decreasing? If you're seeing this type of positive change, then you know your FAQ page is effective. 

### Update Content and Add More Solutions Over Time. 
As your business grows, you should update your FAQ page to include any new questions that become popular over time. For example, if you release a new product or service you'll need to update your FAQ page so that it includes troubleshooting tips for this offer as well. This shows that you take customer success seriously and that you're rolling out new products and services that your team knows how to support.
